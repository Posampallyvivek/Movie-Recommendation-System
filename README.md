Task-2 is movie recommendation system <br>
# Recommendation system
A recommendation system (or recommender system) is a class of machine learning that uses data to help predict, narrow down, and find what people are looking for among an exponentially growing number of options.
# Types Of Recommendation Systems
# 1. Collaborative Filtering
The collaborative filtering method is based on gathering and analyzing data on user’s behavior. This includes the user’s online activities and predicting what they will like based on the similarity with other users.
# 2. Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering methods are based on the description of a product and a profile of the user’s preferred choices. In this recommendation system, products are described using keywords, and a user profile is built to express the kind of item this user likes.
# 3. Hybrid Recommendation Systems
In hybrid recommendation systems, products are recommended using both content-based and collaborative filtering simultaneously to suggest a broader range of products to customers. This recommendation system is up-and-coming and is said to provide more accurate recommendations than other recommender systems.

<h3>In this project we are using content based filtering in the movie recommendation system</h3>
